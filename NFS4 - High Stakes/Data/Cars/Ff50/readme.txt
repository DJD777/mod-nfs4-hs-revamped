Because I never liked the original F50 in the game, I decided to build my own one.
To drive it, just copy the car.viv into your

			C:\...\NFS4\DATA\CARS\FF50

folder.

To have a video wall ingame, copy the FF50.QFS to

			C:\...\NFS4\DATA\FEART\VIDWALL

If you get a serial number conflict, which can be annoying in career mode, try solving the problem with NFSWizard.
I STRONGLY recommend that you replace the old F50 with this one, since it has the same serial number.
However, since I did not consider EA's car performance enough, I edited it a bit, which  means that formerly saved replays
with the old F50 will probably not work, unless you give it the Original carp.txt's.

BUGS:
Because of you cannot REPLACE bodies within the mesh with the game's convertible function, but only ADD one, expert fans will
find the top I made not to be absolutely correct. But I still wanted to make the car convertible, and so the roof I made is
my best try to get the open and the closed version together.
Also, since the 2nd and 3rd upgrade in career mode aren't convertible anymore, there's another problem:
of course, this car has like all others only one mesh for the cockpit view, in which the convertible option is still available
for the last two upgrades.
I suggest you just throw an eye on keeping the roof on the car manually in main menu when playing in career mode.

I just hope you like it, anyway! ;)
It was a damn lot of work to build it, but also much pleasure, so just enjoy!
