I finished my next one, I think it's a pretty nice baby.
I put a lot of work into this one. Again.
To drive it, just copy the car.viv into a directory called


			[GAMEDIR]\DATA\CARS\TTRD


To have a video wall ingame, copy the TTRD.QFS to

			[GAMEDIR]\DATA\FEART\VIDWALL

If you get a serial number conflict, which can be annoying in career mode, try solving the problem with NFSWizard.

---------!!!ATTENTION:!!!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the high polycount of the car, it will not be possible to view it in main menu.
The game will crash saying "RENDER OUT OF RAN".

For this reason I made a zip called "Menufix". You can find it in the "cars" section on my site, since it is needed
to get them running. This patch does nothing but turn the reflection of the car on the ground off.
You can either just put those files into NFS's

			[GAMEDIR]\DATA\MENUS

directory or download any menu skin from any NFS site.
However, I experienced that not all skins or high-poly-cars-bugfixes include all necessary *.mnu-files.
So you might get the car working fine in single race but the game will still crash in one of the career's menus.


The files I included fix EVERY menu so there won't be any restrictions and the car works fine with all features of the game.
However, I can't guarantee that the files will work with every menu skin.

I hope you enjoy my next creation!
I decided to release the roadster first because this way I hope no one will make a coupe out of it ;)
(which is definitely more work than the other way round)
It's just that otherwise it wouldn't have been a week till the first "pseudo-Martin-Leps-TT-roadster" had been on the net,
with my permission or without it. And I don't like that idea much because I want to release a coupe myself.
It is also finished but lacking a damage and upgrades.
I wanted to take my time with the upgrades, so I need 1 or 2 more weeks.
Also, I'm planning to make the new 3.2 litre TT.


If you have any questions, comments or are experiencing problems not mentioned in this readme file, don't hesitate to contact me:

You can of course find all my new releases on my own homepage:

For creating and editing I used Paint Shop Pro, NFS-FCE-Converter, FCETweak, NFSWizard and the Zanoza Modeler.
THANX TO ALL AUTHORS FOR THESE GREAT TOOLS!
...and thanx to EA, of course!
