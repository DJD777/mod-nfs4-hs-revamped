Extract the files:
 car.viv	(Data\Cars\FCar)	serialnumber: 21
(ReadMe.txt	(Data\Cars\FCar))
 FFST.qfs	(Data\FeArt\VidWall)
to your NFS4 directory (where nfshs.exe is located) with 'use folder names' ON.
Else, put the files in the directory between the brackets.

If you want to modify it, like making new textures for it, please contact me.
If this zip-file is unchanged, you can give it to other people for FREE.
Feel free to put it on your website, but contact me, so I can see it (and please show my name(NightEye) and e-mail address).
When you see my car (or a modified version) somewhere else, please tell me.

Have fun with it!!!
